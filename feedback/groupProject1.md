## After our first group project - from Lauren

### Personal

#### Pros

Very friendly and patient to pair with. You explain things with impeccable clearness and can easily adapt to everyone’s pairing needs. JL are very lucky to have someone with such useful people skills. You’re very open to new ideas and have great persistence with problems when testing something you’re unsure of.


#### Improvements

There is very little I can think of that you need to improve on. As I have to give something constructive, I would say that you do have natural leadership skills so you happily jump in. This isn’t a negative in any way, however it could possibly take the experience away from someone else who may want to assume that role. In our group however, we’ve all been so lucky to have such an excellent and considerate lead. I also want to mention that you’re fully aware you’re a leader and have been more than considerate in our group work with it! ( this is a pretty shit improvement as being a leader is sick, you do with with class, consideration and grace and you’re more than kind to those who may want to lead a project so )


### Coding


#### Pros

Your coding abilities are exceptional, you have a great understanding of both javascript and ruby, and your coding fluidity is top notch. You can easily communicate a potential solution and execute it almost perfectly. You have a great debugging process, as you follow ‘tightening the loop’ closely. However, you’re not afraid to play with something if needs be, just to get it working before we test. Your TDD’ing abilities are well practiced too, which can be seen through our initial commits of the makers bnb project as we ‘Red - Green - Refactored’. You follow a great Agile process, and have done an exceptional job keeping us on track with that style of working.

#### Improvements

It’s literally impossible to think of any as I feel you show the key skills of a developer when coding. I guess taking breaks could be one? you’re probably not managing your wellbeing while doing this course and moving house and having a small person! Working through lunch isn’t ideal even if it does create a miracle breakthrough that we had been struggling on all week! I guess yeah, make sure you have some time away from the screen
