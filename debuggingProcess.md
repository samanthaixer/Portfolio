# My debugging process

1. Read the error!
  - What file is the error occurring in and on what line number?
  - What does the error actually say?
    - Have I seen it before, do I know what to do with it?
    - Do I understand the error?
    - Should I look the error up on the Internet?
2. Can I see what line of code is throwing the error?
    - Close the loop until I can clearly see where the issue lies
    - Using `p`, `console.log`, `save and open page` and other techniques to get visibility of what is going on
3. Can I replicate the error in the REPL?
4. If all else fails - have I tried to explain the problem out loud? Sometimes this gives a clue as to where I should be looking!

## Notes

- When trying to find an answer on the Internet
  - Make sure I have understood the problem as best as I can so that my search is specific enough to find something useful
  - Never just copy someone's solution without understanding what it is doing
