During Makers, we started by learning Ruby. We spent a lot of time on this - 4 weeks of pre-course and 4 weeks on site. It was very guided but it gave us a great grounding in various areas as well as Ruby as a language:

1. OOP principles
2. Test driven development
3. Debugging

In week 5 onsite we were asked to learn JavaScript. By ourselves. Just like that. "I can't do this" said my brain. "I'll never learn it" also said my brain. I unfortunately missed the first day of the JavaScript week so I missed the kick-off with all the useful info that brings. I truly was on my own. But I did it! Here's how!

## Look for patterns

- Here's how I would do this in Ruby, I wonder if there's something similar in JavaScript (head to Google)

## Do some reading

- This has served me well when learning Ruby on Rails too - read some of the documentation that comes with the language/library. Even a small amount of background reading or tutorials can help with where to get started.

## Try something out

- On your own machine, you are unlikely to break things by trying things out. If it all goes wrong, dump the code and download from git again.
